## ATMProject
Create an ATM project where the user can manage his bank account using Java loops. Perform ATM transactions using "Switch-Case".

## AddingEvenNumbersAndMultiplesOf4
Write a program in Java that accepts input from the user until a single number is entered using loops, adds even numbers and multiples of 4 from the entered values and prints them on the screen.

## ArmstrongNumbers
If the sum of the nth powers of the digits of an n-digit number is equal to the number itself, such numbers are called Armstrong numbers.

Take the number 407 for example. Returns (4^3)+ (0^3)+(7^3) = 64+0+343 = 407. This shows that the number 407 is an Armstrong number.

Let's also look at the number 1342. Since the number (1^4)+(3^4)+(4^4)+(2^4) =1+81+256+16=354 is not equal to 1342, it is not an Armstrong number.

1634=1^4+6^4+3^4+4^4=1+1296+81+256=1634

54748=5^5+4^5+7^5+4^5+8^5=3125+1024+16807+1024+32768=54748

## DiamondWithStars
Make stars and diamonds using loops in Java.

## EbobEkok
We write a program in Java that finds the GCF and LCM values of two numbers.

GCF: The largest common divisor of two or more natural numbers is called the greatest common divisor of these numbers, in short, GCF.

EXAMPLE: Let's find the greatest common divisor of the numbers 18 and 24 step by step.

Divisors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18

Divisors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24

The largest of these common divisors is the number 6, EBOB.

LCM: The smallest common multiple of two or more natural numbers is called the least common multiple of these numbers, in short, LCM.

EXAMPLE: Let's find the least common multiple of the numbers 6 and 8 step by step.

Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, …

Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, …

The smallest of these common multiples is the number 24, LCM.

LCM = (n1*n2) / GCF

### Homework
Write the GCF and LCM values of two numbers in Java using the "While Loop".

## FactorialAndCombination
The number of different groups with r elements to be formed with the elements of a set with n elements is called the r combination of n. The combination of n with r is shown as C(n,r).

Write a program to calculate combinations in Java.
Combination formula
C(n,r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)

## HarmonicNumbers
It can be shown to diverge using the integral test by comparison with the function 1/x.

## InvertedTriangle
Write a program in Java that takes the number of digits from the user and draws an inverted triangle on the screen with asterisks (*) using loops.

## LargestAndSmallestNumber
Write a program in Java that finds the largest and smallest numbers among N counting numbers entered from the keyboard and writes these numbers to the screen.

## PerfectNumber
It detects whether a number entered from the keyboard is a perfect number or not, and if the number is a perfect number, "it is a perfect number" is displayed on the screen. If not, “it is not the perfect number.” Write a program in Java language that writes the expressions to the screen.

What is a Perfect Number?
A number whose sum of positive integer factors (dividing numbers without remainder) is equal to itself, excluding the number itself, is called a perfect number.

## PrimeNumberBetween1And100
Write a program in Java that prints prime numbers between 1 and 100 on the screen.

## ProgramToCalculateExponents
Create a program in Java that calculates exponents with the values entered by the user using the "For Loop".

## ProgramToFindPowersOf4And5LessThanTheEnteredNumber
Write a program that prints the powers of 4 and 5 up to the entered number using Java loops.
