## AddingEvenNumbersAndMultiplesOf4

Write a program in Java that accepts input from the user until a single number is entered using loops, adds even numbers and multiples of 4 from the entered values and prints them on the screen.

## ArmstrongNumbers

If the sum of the nth powers of the digits of an n-digit number is equal to the number itself, such numbers are called Armstrong numbers.

Take the number 407 for example. Returns (4^3)+ (0^3)+(7^3) = 64+0+343 = 407. This shows that the number 407 is an Armstrong number.

Let's also look at the number 1342. Since the number (1^4)+(3^4)+(4^4)+(2^4) =1+81+256+16=354 is not equal to 1342, it is not an Armstrong number.

1634=1^4+6^4+3^4+4^4=1+1296+81+256=1634

54748=5^5+4^5+7^5+4^5+8^5=3125+1024+16807+1024+32768=54748

## ATMProject

Create an ATM project where the user can manage his bank account using Java loops. Perform ATM transactions using "Switch-Case".

## DiamondWithStars

Make stars and diamonds using loops in Java.

## FactorialAndCombination

The number of different groups with r elements to be formed with the elements of a set with n elements is called the r combination of n. The combination of n with r is shown as C(n,r).

Write a program to calculate combinations in Java.
Combination formula
C(n,r) = n! / (r! * (n-r)!)

## HarmonicNumbers

It can be shown to diverge using the integral test by comparison with the function 1/x.

## ProgramToCalculateExponents

Create a program in Java that calculates exponents with the values entered by the user using the "For Loop".

## ProgramToFindPowersOf4And5LessThanTheEnteredNumber
Write a program that prints the powers of 4 and 5 up to the entered number using Java loops.
